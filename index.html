        <h1>Fate/Binomial Probability [Proof]</h1>
        <h3>14 February 2018 | Sherrinford</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Thanks for checking out my Reddit post on the binomial distribution of the Fate/Grand Order gachas. I didn't think 8,200 people would be interested - I'm just a high school senior with some free time, not a real statistician (shout out to my
        AP Statistics teacher who was kind enough to validate my work). Here, I'll try to explain the statistics concepts behind the probabilities to show why 9.56% isn't actually too high.</p>
        <h2>What's a "binomial distribution"?</h2>
        <p>A binomial distribution is a probability distribution with this definition:</p>
        <img class="irc_mi" src="http://www.stat.yale.edu/Courses/1997-98/101/binprob.gif" alt="Image result for binomial distribution formula" width="354" height="90" />
        <p>n is the number of trials (rolls) and p is the probability of a single success (0.01
        for a single SSR servant card). It's an equation for the probability that the number of successes equals some number k. The first term is called the <strong>binomial coefficient</strong>: the number of ways of arranging k successes among n trials.

        <h3>This is more mathy than the explanation in the post!</h3>
        <p>That's because I calculated the <strong>inverse of the probability of getting absolutely no 5* servants</strong> to find the chance of getting at least one. If k = 0, the binomial coefficient checks out to 1. 0! is 1 (there is only one way to
        arrange 0 successes) and the n! terms cancel out. We end up with 1/1. Working through the rest of the binomial distribution equation with k = 0, p to the 0th power is just 1. We're left with <strong>(1-p)^n</strong> . This means we can treat this
        like an ordinary independent event probability problem - the probability of absolutely no 5* servants in a 10-roll is simply 0.99^10 . Or a different way to put it, the probability of not rolling a 5* servant in a single roll is 0.99, so multiply
        that by itself 10 times. According to statistics, the probabilities of all possible events in a given space must always equal 1. Therefore, the probability of <strong>at least one</strong> 5* servant is 1 minus the probability that we don't get
        any, or<strong> 1 - 0.9044 </strong><strong>= 0.0956.</strong> Keep in mind that this simple explanation only works if we want to know the probability of rolling <strong>at least one</strong> type of card. To know the probability of at least four
        5* servants in a 10-roll, we'd have to plug k = 0, 1, 2, 3 and n = 10 into the long equation, add the answers together, and subtract that from 1 (you'd have to have EX luck to roll this). Or just use the binomcdf() shortcut in a graphing calculator
        :D</p>
        <h3>Conditions that must be satisfied before using the binomial distribution</h3>
        <p>We know a distribution is binomial if...</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="color:black; font-size:20px;"><strong>There are only two outcomes for each trial. </strong>For each roll, you either get a 5* servant or you don't.</li>
          <li style="color:black; font-size:20px;"><strong>All trials are independent of each other. </strong>Oh man, I would love it if DW implemented a cumulative probability thing where the chance of getting a 5* would increase the more you don't roll one.</li>
          <li style="color:black; font-size:20px;"><strong>The number of trials is fixed. </strong>For each calculation, I defined the probability as for a 10-roll, 100 rolls, etc. If we want to know the probability for the # of rolls before the first 5* as the # of rolls approaches infinity,
            that's the realm of geometric distribution.</li>
          <li style="color:black; font-size:20px;"><strong>The probability of success for each trial is fixed. </strong>DW states the probability of a 5* servant is 0.01. This is where this study could have some inaccuracies, since we don't know how rate-ups and guaranteed 4*+ works.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Feel free to DM me on Reddit if you have any questions on how this works or want me to quantify your luck. I can't promise when I'll get back to you though, because I need to do my actual AP Stats homework.</p>
        <p>Cheers!</p>
