          <h2>Fate/Unlimited Probability Works [Proof]</h2>
          <h3>16 March 2018</h3>
          <br>
          <p>Yay! Chapter 5 is finally out! (Nightingale please come home ;-;) If you're here from Reddit, thanks for taking the time to check out my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DwCoMzkWUTCboXUN8Vu8Eys3PUbmdzQ3UYUlD95us1I/edit?usp=sharing">sprawling spreadsheet.</a>            I hope this helps everyone roll responsibly in the future. :P</p>
          <h2>Geometric vs. Binomial Distribution</h2>
          <p>The geometric distributions in the spreadsheet are different from the binomial distributions I posted in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/grandorder/comments/7x7af7/gacha_probability_infographic/">infographic last month.</a></p>
          <p>In a binomial problem, the number of trials is fixed (ex. you know you want to roll exactly 10 times). However, in a geometric problem, you just keep rolling until you get whatever type of card you want. Basically, a cumulative geometric distribution
            answers the question, "If you had an infinite supply of Saint Quartz, what would be the probability of getting the type of card you want in x rolls?"</p>
          <h2>Conditions:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li style="color:black; font-size:20px;"><strong>There are only two outcomes for each trial. </strong>For each roll, you either get [type of card], or you don’t.</li>
            <li style="color:black; font-size:20px;"><strong>All trials are independent of each other. </strong>Oh man, I would love it if DW implemented a cumulative probability thing where the chance of getting a 5* would increase the more you don’t roll one.</li>
            <li style="color:black; font-size:20px;"><strong>The probability of success for each trial is fixed. </strong>DW states the probability of a 5* servant is 0.01, 4* servant is 0.03, and 5* CE is 0.04. I divided 0.01 by 14 (current number of Story Gacha 5* servants in NA) to populate
              the Story Gacha column. Rate-up is assumed to be 70% of the probability for any [type of card].</li>
            <li style="color:black; font-size:20px;"><strong>The variable of interest is the # of trials required to observe the first success. </strong>With a binomial distribution, the variable of interest was the number of successes (i.e. number of 5* servants). Instead, in a geometric distribution,
              the variable of interest is how many rolls it takes to get the first [type of card].</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Math</h2>
          <p>The common formula for the probability that it takes more than n trials (rolls) to see the first success (type of card you want) is <strong>P(x > n) = </strong><strong>(1-P)^n, </strong>where P is the probability of getting a [type of card]
            in a single roll. However, we're interested in the other way around, which is "the probability of seeing the first success in x rolls". The formula then becomes <strong>P(x <= n) = 1 - ((1-P)^n) </strong>because the probability of all possible
            events combined must always be 1. If we want to know the probability of all the events excluding certain events, we use the 1 minus. Let's use finding the chance of getting any 5* servant in the first 50 rolls as an example. Using the above
            formula, the probability of getting any 5* servant in the first 50 rolls is P(x
            <=5 0)=1 - ((1-0.01)^50)=< strong>0.39499</strong>. Does the right side of the formula look familiar? That's because it's the same one for the probability of getting one or more 5* in a fixed number of rolls, but the logic behind it is slightly different. Since it's a cumulative
              distribution, the first success could occur on any roll between 1 and 50, but we never said you couldn't get any more 5* after!</p>

          <h2>Fate/Binomial Probability [Proof]</h2>
          <h3>14 February 2018</h3>
          <br>
          <p>Thanks for checking out my Reddit post on the binomial distribution of the Fate/Grand Order gachas. I didn't think 8,200 people would be interested - I'm just a high school senior with some free time, not a real statistician (shout out to my
            AP Statistics teacher who was kind enough to validate my work). Here, I'll try to explain the statistics concepts behind the probabilities to show why 9.56% isn't actually too high.</p>
          <h2>What's a "binomial distribution"?</h2>
          <p>A binomial distribution is a probability distribution with this definition:</p>
          <img class="irc_mi" src="http://www.stat.yale.edu/Courses/1997-98/101/binprob.gif" alt="Image result for binomial distribution formula" width="354" height="90" />
          <p>n is the number of trials (rolls) and p is the probability of a single success (0.01 for a single SSR servant card). It's an equation for the probability that the number of successes equals some number k. The first term is called the <strong>binomial coefficient</strong>:
            the number of ways of arranging k successes among n trials.

            <img class="irc_mi" src="http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/DerivativeProofs_files/eq0036P.gif" alt="Image result for binomial coefficient" width="242" height="100" />
            <h3>This is more mathy than the explanation in the post!</h3>
            <p>That's because I calculated the <strong>inverse of the probability of getting absolutely no 5* servants</strong> to find the chance of getting at least one. If k = 0, the binomial coefficient checks out to 1. 0! is 1 (there is only one way
              to arrange 0 successes) and the n! terms cancel out. We end up with 1/1. Working through the rest of the binomial distribution equation with k = 0, p to the 0th power is just 1. We're left with <strong>(1-p)^n</strong> . This means we can
              treat this like an ordinary independent event probability problem - the probability of absolutely no 5* servants in a 10-roll is simply 0.99^10 . Or a different way to put it, the probability of not rolling a 5* servant in a single roll
              is 0.99, so multiply that by itself 10 times. According to statistics, the probabilities of all possible events in a given space must always equal 1. Therefore, the probability of <strong>at least one</strong> 5* servant is 1 minus the probability
              that we don't get any, or<strong> 1 - 0.9044 </strong><strong>= 0.0956.</strong> Keep in mind that this simple explanation only works if we want to know the probability of rolling <strong>at least one</strong> type of card. To know the probability
              of at least four 5* servants in a 10-roll, we'd have to plug k = 0, 1, 2, 3 and n = 10 into the long equation, add the answers together, and subtract that from 1 (you'd have to have EX luck to roll this). Or just use the binomcdf() shortcut
              in a graphing calculator :D
            </p>
            <h3>Conditions that must be satisfied before using the binomial distribution</h3>
            <p>We know a distribution is binomial if...</p>
            <ol>
              <li style="color:black; font-size:20px;"><strong>There are only two outcomes for each trial. </strong>For each roll, you either get a 5* servant or you don't.</li>
              <li style="color:black; font-size:20px;"><strong>All trials are independent of each other. </strong>Oh man, I would love it if DW implemented a cumulative probability thing where the chance of getting a 5* would increase the more you don't roll one.</li>
              <li style="color:black; font-size:20px;"><strong>The number of trials is fixed. </strong>For each calculation, I defined the probability as for a 10-roll, 100 rolls, etc. If we want to know the probability for the # of rolls before the first 5* as the # of rolls approaches infinity,
                that's the realm of geometric distribution.</li>
              <li style="color:black; font-size:20px;"><strong>The probability of success for each trial is fixed. </strong>DW states the probability of a 5* servant is 0.01. This is where this study could have some inaccuracies, since we don't know how rate-ups and guaranteed 4*+ works.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Feel free to DM me on Reddit if you have any questions on how this works or want me to quantify your luck. I can't promise when I'll get back to you though, because I need to do my actual AP Stats homework.</p>
